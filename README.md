### Comitting and creating Merge Requests

0. Before you start, please create a Personal Access Token. Give it all the possible scopes. Use this as your `password` for when you do git clone or pull for the first time. You may also need to configure your git config:

```bash
git config user.name FirstName
git config user.email firstname.lastname@bobthecoder.com
```

1. First, you need to create a new branch

   - It should be based on the `development` branch.
   - This branch should follow the format of `name/UC-XXXX` for example, `ranjith/UC-9435`.

2. Then, when you're ready, create a new Merge Request

   - Here is a good example of a completed merge request:https://github.com/bob-the-coder-community/next-www/pull/28
   - Set the Source branch as your branch (e.g. `ranjith/UC-9435`) and the Target branch as `development`.
   - Write a small description (there is a template provided).

3. Wait for the `build` pipeline and get Approvals
   - If you click on the progress icon, you'll see it will likely spin off 1-2 build jobs.
   - These jobs run `prettier`, `eslint` and `tsc` checks.
   - Once they're done, you will need **1 approvals** from Developers other than yourself and you can then merge!
   - If you've made a new commit, unfortunately all your existing approvals will be erased.
